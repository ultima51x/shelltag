shelltag
*****************************
shelltag is intended to be a mp3 id3 tagging program that is run in the 
command line/shell.  At the moment, it can delete all tags, create a tag
in an empty file, remove fields, and add fields.  This was built for my
personal use for my tagging needs to suppplement GUI-based programs such
as Mp3Tag or MP3BookHelper.

This was created for my personal use due to boredom and the source is
being released due to what's required under the GNU General Public
License v.2.  shelltag acts as a wrapper for the mutagen tagging library.

shelltag uses the following
---------------------------
* Python 2.6
* mutagen 1.19
This is the ID3 tagging library shelltag uses.
* compatid3.py (from picard)
This adds support for ID3v2.3.  For ease of building, compatid3.py 
is included in the shelltag/shelltag directory.

Requirements
------------
* Microsoft Windows
(NOTE: it might work under a Unix-like system, but it hasn't been tested)
* Python 2.6
* mutagen 1.19
A copy of mutagen (mutagen-1.19.tar.gz) used in shelltag is included
in this folder. mutagen must be setup using the directions within the
mutagen tarball.

How to use
----------
You can either...
1. Leave the directory hierarchy intact and run shelltag.py from there.
2. $ python setup.py install
to have all the supporting modules added using distutils, so that you
only need to keep the shelltag.py file.

$ shelltag.py
Prints the usage

$ shelltag.py -a ARTIST "D:\\blah.mp3" Radiohead
Make ARTIST -> Radiohead in D:\blah.mp3.

$ shelltag.py --help
Prints a listing of all available commands
